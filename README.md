### Extensibility at Core
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add new storage providers without modifying core code
- **Provider Interface**: Well-defined contracts for implementing custom storage solutions
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Storage providers can be configured and switched at runtime
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Use different storage providers for different document types or tenants

### Potential Extensions
The architecture supports integration with:
- Cloud storage services (Azure Blob, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Enterprise storage systems (SharePoint, OneDrive, Box)
- Custom storage solutions specific to your organization
- Hybrid storage configurations

## üìä Key Technical Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear layer boundaries
- **UnitOfWork Pattern**: Consistent transaction management
- **Value Comparers**: Proper EF Core collection handling
- **Current User Service**: Seamless user context tracking
- **Reference Handling**: Advanced JSON serialization with circular reference support
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Built-in conflict resolution
